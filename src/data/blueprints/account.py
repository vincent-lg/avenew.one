"""Blueprint document for accounts.

It is rare to place accounts in blueprints and this can be a security
risk, should the blueprints be shared with others.  If
you have to place accounts in blueprints, remember to keep it light
and only build the bare minimum for testing (an admin account,
a player account).

WARNING: an account blueprint contains the account password.
Keep that in mind before sharing the file.
