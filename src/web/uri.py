    A prgram is a Python callable which is linked to a URI.  The page
    is a template that matches this URI.  A page can exist without a
    program.  A program can exist without a page.  If neither page nor
    program can be found at this URI, a 404 error is raised.

    Prgrams and pages can apply to a specific method of an URI.  For
    instance, if the user wishes to access the URI /about, it is possible
    to have different programs (and pages) depending on whether the
    request asked for a GET or POST method.
